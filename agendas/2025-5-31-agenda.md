# 2025-5-31 Meeting Agenda
- talk about next steps
- schedule next meeting Sat 7/12 6pm? 
in flush out development process

## Status Updates
- software development environment created to migrate to CMake:
  - https://github.com/Mouse-Unit-07/software-development-environment
  - Hello World project to clone into src/ folder to test the development environment:
    - https://github.com/Mouse-Unit-07/software-hello-world
  - list of installations and setup required on a Windows machine here: 
    - https://github.com/Mouse-Unit-07/team-guides/blob/main/guides/software-environment/software-environment-setup-guide.md
- ...Docker not happening T-T Linux AVR32 toolchain isn't mainstream enough
- Jenkins work not done yet 

## Next Steps
  - Ryuichi: finish Jenkins
    - ...once Jenkins is in place, we an agree on highest level software architecture sketch trigger all software development:
      - AT32UC3L0256 firmware rewrite
      - Maze algo upgrades
      - C++ test software
      - Command Line Interface
  - Chris L / Andy: finish readings
    - let's switch mode and read TLDR notes and give light pass through Clean Code / TDD book for your language- as long as we get the gist and know where to look for things in each book, we're good to go
      - tldr for Clean Code and tdd:
        - https://github.com/Mouse-Unit-07/team-guides/tree/main/key-readings/tldr-notes
      - light pass through these two:
        - **Clean Code**
        - TDD for your language:
          - Andy: **Test-Driven Development for Embedded C**
          - Chris L: **Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development: Code Better, Sleep Better**
  - Chris L: UART bridge
    - rough test to confirm that the ESP32 module works
      - no need for TDD- just confirming that hardware works is good
    - references here: https://github.com/Mouse-Unit-07/discussions/discussions/2
  - Chris L: C++ Hello World
    - can you create a C++ Hello World repo just like the C Hello World repo w/ a TDD test that you can clone into the development environment?
    - (All links needed are at the top under Status Updates)
  - Chris F: Linux compatibility for new development environment
    - could you add Linux compatibility to software development environement?
      - development repo here: https://github.com/Mouse-Unit-07/software-environment-creation
      - we can't have the environment build for MCU on Linux unless we use the old AVR32 Linux toolchain on Git, but let's extend this development environment for if you want to work on Linux
  - Andy Zhuo: Starting Command Line Interface
    - could you look into the most scalable implementation of a command line interface in C (no growing switch case statements, etc) and try writing it w/ TDD and our new environment?
    - it should use C's standard IO (printf(), fgets(), etc)
    - implement just a print hello world command for now- if the structure is laid out to add more commands we're good to go  
  - later tasks:
    - build new mouse and test new firmware on new cork board maze
    - experiment w/ new hardware upgrades if needed or time allows
